In this analysis of a large agricultural company's data using a two-way ANOVA, several key findings emerged. The experiment involved two factors, Grass Species (A) and Fertilizer Type (B), each with two and three levels, respectively. The response variable was the number of blades per species. Three groups of boxplots were created, highlighting the significant differences observed. Outliers were identified in Species 1 and a specific species-fertilizer combination.
Recommendations based on the analysis suggested that Species 1, particularly when combined with Fertilizer 3, exhibited more favorable outcomes in terms of the number of blades. The statistical analysis, including a two-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test, supported these recommendations. While the interaction effect between species and fertilizer was not significant, both main effects (species and fertilizer) demonstrated significant differences.
The equal variance condition was not fully met due to outliers and variances across different groups. However, normality assumptions were generally satisfied. The Tukey's HSD test revealed that the combination of Species 1 and Fertilizer 3 (Group 1.3) stood out as statistically different from the other combinations.
Visualizations, including boxplots and interaction plots, further supported the interpretation of main effects and their interactions. Bar plots with error bars were created for both main effects, clearly representing the mean number of blades for each species and fertilizer combination.
In conclusion, the combination of Species 1 with Fertilizer 3 is recommended based on the statistically significant differences observed in the number of blades. The visualizations and statistical analyses provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing blade growth in different grass species and under various fertilizer conditions.
